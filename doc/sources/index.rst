Welcome to Kivy
===============

Welcome to Kivy's documentation. Kivy is an open source software library for rapid
development of applications equipped with novel user interfaces, such as
multi-touch apps.
We recommend that you get started with :ref:`installation` and then head over to
the :ref:`quickstart` document. Besides the quickstart, there is also a more
detailed :ref:`tutorial` that shows how to create an application with Kivy.
