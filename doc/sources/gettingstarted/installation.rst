.. note::

   `Python 3.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ has recently been
   released, but for technical reasons we can't provide binary Kivy packages
   yet.

   For the time being, please use one of the supported versions up to and
   including Python 3.6. Alternatively, it's also possible to compile it
   yourself, for example by following the instructions for the development
   version below.
